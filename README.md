Project three done by Catherine Sansarricq, Gita Natalia, Agastya Kabir Mahapatra, and Wisdom Chimezie

Instructions on interacting with Project:

Our jupyter notebook is a compilation of the code we all made to analzye the data set, each visualization consists of code analyzing the data and then a labelled visualization
in the forms of bar charts, pie charts, interactive charts, tree maps, and geographical maps, corresponding to the analyses.
Then we have 2 html pages, one consisting of by state year-over-year data of sales and profit, and the other is an interactive map showcasing the sales and profit by state. 

Ethical Considerations:

In conducting this project, we priorized ethical considerations to ensure fairness and accuracy in our analyses. Our original data set consisted of names along with orders, so although the 
data was not anonymized, we employed great care to ensure it was handled responsibly and securely. We ensured that sensitive data was not misused outside the scope of our project.
We made efforts to ensure that our biases did not take part in our analysis of the data, and ensured that no biases were introduced in our interpretation of the results. We ensured our
findings were grounded in data-driven insights rather than subjective assumptions. The results and visualizations are provided with an emphasis on transperancy with a focus on accuracy, 
clarity, and actionable insights that align with ethical standards in data analysis and business decision making.

Reference for data source:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final/data
Superstore data was sourced from kaggle.

Our github consists of two data sources, superstore_data.csv and superstore2.csv. These datasets are virtually identical, but while working on SQL, we noticed our original dataset's columns
included spaces so we replaced them with underscores in superstore2.csv. For example, "Ship Mode" was converted to "Ship_Mode". These two sources were used interchangeably in our notebook,
but they are one and the same. 

Reference for code:

All code was done by members of the project. The tutor (tutoring service provided by bootcamp) assissted in generating code for the HTML and Javascript which generate 
year-over-year sales and profit data by state.
